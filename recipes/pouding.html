<h2><div class="titlefont"> Description </div></h2>
<p>Pouding chômeur, or "unemployed person's pudding," is a classic French-Canadian dessert with humble origins rooted in Quebec's economic history. 
Created during the Great Depression in the early 20th century, it was a simple yet ingenious creation born out of necessity.
The dessert consists of a rich cake batter poured over a layer of brown sugar and butter, then baked until the cake rises and forms a golden crust while the sugar and butter create a decadent caramel sauce at the bottom. 
Originally devised as an affordable treat using readily available pantry ingredients, pouding chômeur quickly became a beloved comfort food among working-class families. Despite its modest beginnings, it has endured as a cherished symbol of resilience and resourcefulness in Quebecois culinary culture, celebrated for its comforting flavors and nostalgic appeal.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Butter a deep baking dish and place it on a sheet pan.</li>
    <li>Bring maple syrup and heavy cream to a boil in a deep saucepan over medium-high heat. Turn off heat once mixture starts to bubble, stir, and set aside.</li>
    <li>Beat butter and sugar together in a bowl using a spatula or electric mixer until creamy and well combined. Whisk in vanilla extract and 1 egg until incorporated. Mix in the other egg. Sprinkle in baking powder, salt, and flour. Mix with a spatula until batter is just combined.</li>
    <li>Transfer batter to the prepared dish and pour the maple-cream sauce on top, stopping between 1/2 to 1-inch from the top of the dish. Reserve any extra sauce.</li>
    <li>Bake in the center of the preheated oven until pudding is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out mostly clean, about 30 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes; serve pudding with any extra maple-cream sauce.</li>
