<h2>Description</h2>
<p> Poutine's origins trace back to rural Quebec in the late 1950s, where it emerged as a humble and satisfying snack. The dish's exact creation story is debated, with multiple accounts attributing its inception to different restaurants and individuals in the region. One popular narrative suggests that a restaurateur named Fernand Lachance was asked by a customer to combine cheese curds with fries and gravy in a single dish, leading to the birth of poutine. Originally regarded as a simple and inexpensive meal, poutine gradually gained popularity across Canada and internationally, evolving into a beloved comfort food staple that embodies the heartiness and warmth of Canadian cuisine.</p>
